						<h2>Study of motor vehicule collisions in the city of New-York
						</h2>
						<p>The data are provided by the Police Department (NYPD). This dataset records all the vehicle collisions that happened in New York since July 2012, until March 2017. One row describes one accident, with a lot of different features: date, time, precise location, borough, vehicle types, causes of the collision, number of people injured or killed and their description (pedestrian, cyclist, etc...).</p>
						<p>We believe that looking back at all the accidents that have happened in New-York, knowing exactly where it happened, can help a lot in terms of prevention. Indeed a good visualisation could greatly assist the police department and give them an insight in where they need to be the more focused.
						That is why, to go further we worked on our data in order to be able to construct a prediction at the end of that page.</p>

					<h3>Data engineering</h3>
					<p>For the sake of our analysis, data engineering is very heavy for this prediction. Indeed, we have to gather any set of 6 hours in a row and their associated label. Let's go through the successive steps of our data preparation.
						<ol type="square">
						    <li>New hour indexing</li>
					<li>Data engineering (6 hours in a row)</li>
					<li>One hot encoding of the categorical variable</li>
					<li>Dataset balancing</li>
					<li>Train/test separation</li>
					<ol/>

					<br/>
					Hereafter, an overview of the final dataset we will use for the accidents forecasting.

							<h3>Logistic Regression Classification</h3>
							<p>We want to run a classification task from 30 features: 6 features describing the 6 previous hours of the dataset, as well as the one-hot-encoded category for the hour of the day we are looking at. We applied a Logistic Regression to this dataset, in order to most relevant features here. This method gave us an accuracy of approximately 62 % (details given in the explanatory notebook). Hereafter a visualization of our accuracy on the 30 most populated zipcodes. </p>

							<h3>Support Vector Machine</h3>

							<p>We tried to improve our prediction applying support vector machine classification. Though, the results were not better, with still an accuracy around 63 %. We also implemented a lot of other methods such as Adaboost.M1 classifier applied to decision trees (as weak classifier). We also tried K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, as well as some discriminant analysis. Though, SVM were still the best option, despite a very long computation time. Hereafter, our predictions on the 30 most populated zipcodes.</p>

					<h3>D3 visualization predictions</h3>
					<p>We are still aiming to apply our machine learning experiments to actual improvement of New-York security. Let's simulate a real-life case and visualize it. We will pick one zipcode (XXXXX, in Brooklyn), and try to simulate a whole day. Predicting from the actual 6 previous hours, we will compare our predictions (hour by hour), and what actually happened on that day. D3 VIZ TO INSERT BELOW</p>
